## ðŸ§  Summary of Phase 1 Presentation
This presentation explores a parallel algorithmic framework for efficiently updating Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) in dynamic networks. Instead of recomputing shortest paths from scratch after each network change, the proposed method identifies affected subgraphs and updates them selectively.

Key points:
- Supports both **CPU (OpenMP)** and **GPU (OpenCL)** parallelism.
- Uses **MPI** for distributed execution.
- Employs **METIS** for graph partitioning across MPI processes.
- Introduces **Vertex-Marking Functional Blocks (VMFB)** for GPU efficiency.
- Achieves up to **8.5x GPU** and **5x CPU** speedups over traditional recomputation methods.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies
- **Languages**: C++, CUDA/OpenCL
- **Libraries**: MPI, OpenMP, METIS
- **Platforms**: Shared-memory multicore systems, NVIDIA GPUs
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
-  implementation of the proposed algorithm using MPI and OpenMP/OpenCL.
- Evaluate performance on public graph datasets.
- Analyze scalability and document Phase 2 findings.
